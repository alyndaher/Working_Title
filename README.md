# Project Name: 
Life Expectancy in the Twin Cities Metro
# Question: 
What factors impact Life Expectancy in the MN Twin Cities Metro counties?
# Factors Used: 
Median Household Income, Population Density, Emissions, Number of Hospitals, Education Level, Unemployment
# Jupyter Notebooks:
* Median Household Income - Median_Household_Income.ipynb
* Population Density - Population_project_1.ipynb
* Emissions - emissions.ipynb
* Number of Hospitals - hospital_data.ipynb
* Education Level & Unemployment- Project 1 - Jim.ipynb 

# Overall Findings: 
* Median Household Income has strong positive correlation (coefficient= 0.85) with life expectancy.
* Unemployment has strong negative correlation (coefficient= -0.7) with life expectancy.
* All other factors were insignificant with p-values greater than 0.05 and there is not a clear relationship with life expectancy.
